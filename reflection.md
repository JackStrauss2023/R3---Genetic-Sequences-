Throughout the project, I learned how to solve a solution by using string manipulation. This was new to me and was challenging. But, I was able to work through the problems and learn a lot of new things. There were five problems that I had to solve. Each solution was organized and placed into a function, which was later called in the code.

The first problem's solution needed to count the number of nucleotides in the genetic sequence. In the solution, I learned how to convert a string to an array, and then filter the objects in the array into different groups, in which they were able to be counted. 

The second problem's solution needed to replace all of the T characters with U characters. I solved this problem with this code, DNA_STRING_FOR_rna.replace(/T/g, "U");. I learned how to replace all of the T characters with the U characters in the string.

The third problem's solution needed to flip the string and then replace all of the T characters to A characters, all of the A characters to T characters, all of the G characters to C characters, and all of the C characters to G characters. I learned how to flip the string then replace the letters with the method I learned in problem 2. The characters were still flipping because they were uppercased, so I changed all of the characters to lower case. Next, I used a new function to upper case the letters in the string with the function toUpperCase().

The fourth problem's solution needed to determine the number of corresponding nucleotides that differ in the two sequences. I learned how to do this by using a loop that went through each string and if a letter in string 1 did not equal the letter in string 2 then 1 would be added to the variable, dist = 0.

The fifth problem's solution needed to determine where the substring, ATAT, was located in the genetic sequence. Through loops, I was able to draw multiple lines to locate the specific letters in the genetic sequence.
